# A vowel counter in Java
To use this program to count the vowels in a String, please first fork this repository. 

1. In the file "vowelCounter.java" you will find the String variable named "str" in line 4, which is the input String. You may change this String to your own input String.
2. Then you can run the main function in the IDE of your choice (we tested it on vs code).
3. The program will then print out the number of vowels in the standard output.

4. Alternatively, you can use the terminal instead of an IDE to run this program; for this, first go to the directory where you cloned this repository on your local machine, then compile the code with "javac vowelCounter.java" and then run it with "java vowelCounter"
